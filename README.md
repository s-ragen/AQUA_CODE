# AQUA Project Code

This repository contains code for looking at model output for MOM6-SIS2 coupled aquaplanet model runs. This project uses an idealized ocean model with the hope of building understanding of large-scale, climate-relevant phenomena like northward ocean heat transport (OHT), and the meridional overturning circulation (MOC).

### Overarching research questions include: 
  - What is the fundamental role of ocean circulation in climate asymmetries (i.e. pole to equator temperature gradient, distribution of rainfall and clouds, and overturning circulation)? 
  - How does ocean circulation influence the climate's reponse to forcing (i.e. spatial pattern of warming, heat uptake, sealevel rise, and ocean circulation and global climate sensitivity)?

### Specific research question for this project:
  - How much do the shape of the Atlantic basin coastlines influence northward OHT and the MOC? Does the shape of the eastern or western boundary play a larger role?
  - How do basin width and coastline shape modulate the subtropical overturning cells and associated OHT?
